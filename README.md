#Let's build a game in python together!

#recommended to use python 3.10.7

#dependencies are in requirements.txt file
#you can install them with pip3 install -r requirements.txt
#I use github copilot so sometimes things get a little screwy ;)

sorry I am pretty new to github and python so if I am going about this the incorrect way please let me know.

Feel free to contribute 

check TODO for some tasks and brainstorming
