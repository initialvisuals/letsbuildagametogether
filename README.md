#Let's build a game in python together!

My name is Evan and I am learning python in my free time. I have some experience with game development in the past so I will be handling some design, programming, audio, art etc... but I like collaborating so feel free to hop aboard.

We can release the game for free for clout, if we like it as a polished game maybe we can talk monetary insentives later. 

#recommended to use python 3.10.7

#dependencies are in requirements.txt file
#if you have any questions feel free to ask me personally or on discord. 

#I use github copilot so sometimes things get a little screwy ;)

sorry I am pretty new to github and python so if I am going about this the incorrect way please let me know.

Feel free to contribute 

check TODO for some tasks and brainstorming
